# Music App UI Design with Flutter

🎨A flutter ui project inspired by this Ui design by the work of [Ux Derrick](https://uxderrick.com) and [his tweet](https://twitter.com/uxderrick/status/1745841051825258846?t=Be-v9nbm0F0VzR--WZUdKg&s=19).

🔗Here is a link to the 👉🏾[original design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ruWy8lRd6GRi7i5ayPgv0R/Game-UI-design-Challenge?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev) .


Feel free to clone the project and play around with it.I tried to organize the code as much as possible.
Dont forget to give it a star ⭐️ if you like it.
